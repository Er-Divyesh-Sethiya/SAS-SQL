# SAS-SQL
working on sas sql.

- SQL is a standardized, widely used language that retrieves data from and updates data in tables and the views that are based on those tables. The SAS SQL procedure enables you to do the following: retrieve and manipulate data that is stored in tables or views. create tables, views, and indexes on columns in tables.

- The SAS SQL procedure enables you to do the following:

- retrieve and manipulate data that is stored in tables or views.
- create tables, views, and indexes on columns in tables.
- create SAS macro variables that contain values from rows in a query's result.
- add or modify the data values in a tableâ€™s columns or insert and delete rows. You can also modify the table itself by adding, modifying, or dropping columns.
- send DBMS-specific SQL statements to a database management system (DBMS) and retrieve DBMS data.


- The following figure summarizes the variety of source material that you can use with PROC SQL and what the procedure can produce.

- A PROC SQL table is synonymous with a SAS data set and has a member type of DATA. You can use PROC SQL tables as input into DATA steps and procedures.

- You create PROC SQL tables from SAS data sets, from SAS views, or from DBMS tables by using PROC SQL's pass-through facility or the SAS/ACCESS LIBNAME statement. The pass-through facility is described in Connecting to a DBMS By Using the SQL Procedure Pass-Through Facility. The SAS/ACCESS LIBNAME statement is described in Connecting to a DBMS By Using the LIBNAME Statement.

- In PROC SQL terminology, a row in a table is the same as an observation in a SAS data set. A column is the same as a variable.
