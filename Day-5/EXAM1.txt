
SAS 9.4 Base Programming – Performance-based Exam
Practical Programming Questions:

Project 1:
This project will use data set sashelp.shoes.
Write a SAS program that will:
• Read sashelp.shoes as input.
• Create the SAS data set work.sortedshoes.
• Sort the sashelp.shoes data set:
o First by variable product in descending order.
o Second by variable sales in ascending order.
Run the program and answer the following questions:
Question 1: What is the value of the product variable in observation 148?
Answer: xxxxx
Question 2: What is the value of the Region variable in observation 130?
Answer: xxxxx

Project 2:
This project will use the data set sashelp.shoes.
Write a SAS program that will:
• Read sashelp.shoes as input.
• Create a new SAS data set, work.shoerange.
• Create a new character variable SalesRange that will be used to categorize the observations into
three groups.
• Set the value of SalesRange to the following:
o Lower when Sales are less than $100,000.
o Middle when Sales are between $100,000 and $200,000, inclusively.
o Upper when Sales are above $200,000.
Run the program, then use additional SAS procedures to answer the following questions:
Question 3: How many observations are classified into the “Lower” group? 
Answer: xxxxx
Question 4: What is the mean value of the Sales variable for observations in the “Middle” group? Round
your answer to the nearest whole number.
Answer: xxxxx

Project 3:
This project will work with the following program:
data work.lowchol work.highchol;
 set sashelp.heart;
 if cholesterol lt 200 output work.lowchol;
 if cholesterol ge 200 output work.highchol;
 if cholesterol is missing output work.misschol;
run;
This program is intended to:
• Divide the observations of sashelp.heart into three data sets, work.highchol, work.lowchol, and
work.misschol
• Only observations with cholesterol below 200 should be in the work.lowchol data set.
• Only Observations with cholesterol that is 200 and above should be in the work.highchol data
set.
• Observations with missing cholesterol values should only be in the work.misschol data set.
Fix the errors in the above program. There may be multiple errors in the program. Errors may be syntax
errors, program structure errors, or logic errors. In the case of logic errors, the program may not
produce an error in the log.
After fixing all of the errors in the program, answer the following questions:
Question 5: How many observations are in the work.highchol data set?
Answer: xxxxx
Question 6: How many observations are in the work.lowchol data set?
Answer: xxxxx

Standard Questions:
Question 7:
The following SAS program is submitted:
data WORK.TEMP;
Char1='0123456789';
Char2=substr(Char1,3,4);
 run;
What is the value of Char2?
A. 23
B. 34
C. 345
D. 2345
Answer: xxxxx

Question 8:
The following SAS program is submitted:
proc format;
value score 1 - 50 = 'Fail'
 51 - 100 = 'Pass';
run;
Which one of the following PRINT procedure steps correctly applies the format?
A. proc print data = SASUSER.CLASS;
var test;
format test score;
 run;
B. proc print data = SASUSER.CLASS;
var test;
format test score.;
 run;
C. proc print data = SASUSER.CLASS format = score;
var test;
 run;
D. proc print data = SASUSER.CLASS format = score.;
var test;
 run;
Answer: xxxxx

Question 9:
Given the SAS data set WORK.ONE:
Revenue2008 Revenue2009 Revenue2010
----------- ----------- -----------
1.2 1.6 2.0
The following SAS program is submitted:
data WORK.TWO;
set WORK.ONE;
Total=sum(of Rev:);
run;
What value will SAS assign to Total?
A) 3
B) 1.6
C) 4.8
D) The program fails to execute due to errors.
Answer: xxxxx

Question 10:
Given the SAS data set WORK.INPUT:
Var1 Var2
------ -------
A one
A two
B three
C four
A five
The following SAS program is submitted:
data WORK.ONE WORK.TWO;
set WORK.INPUT;
if Var1='A' then output WORK.ONE;
output;
run;
